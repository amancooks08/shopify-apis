# shopify-apis
This is an implementation of a bunch of APIs to interact with various Shopify marketplaces.
These are a set of APIs that interface with a Shopify store to manage products, handle cart operations, and process orders. Additionally, the APIs enable the assignment of UTM tags to orders post-purchase.
